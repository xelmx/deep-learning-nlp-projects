I will be using a series of text preprocessing techniques to do this. The plan is to handle unique noise I found in the data convert text to lowercase, get rid of punctuation, break sentences into words \"tokenization\" and remove common, unimportant words \"stopwords\". The main purpose of all this is to make the text data clean and structured, so it's ready for more advanced tasks like sentiment analysis."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"VBJff1K7ezV4","metadata":{"id":"VBJff1K7ezV4"},"source":["Setting Up the Environment: Importing Libraries\n","\n","This initial section of the code is all about getting our tools ready. To work with the data and clean the text, we need to bring in some powerful Python libraries. First, by importing \"pandas\", we get the functions needed to handle our data in a table format, which makes it easy to work with. On the other hand, the \"re\" library is for \"regular expressions\" and it is perfect for finding and removing specific text patterns like dates or punctuation. Finally, we import \"nltk\", the Natural Language Toolkit, which is the standard library for almost any text processing task in Python.\n","\n","After importing the main libraries, we need to download two specific packages from NLTK. The first is \"stopwords\", which is a ready-made list of common English words we'll want to remove later. The second is \"punkt\", a pre-trained model that knows how to properly split sentences into individual words in a process called tokenization. This step makes sure all our tools are loaded and ready before we even touch the data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"id":"2b92c4f1","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":24,"status":"ok","timestamp":1754149077765,"user":{"displayName":"Lyle Earl Rementizo","userId":"08463900326265129633"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"2b92c4f1"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import re\n","import nltk"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"id":"-qJL8zU3hT_g","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":313,"status":"ok","timestamp":1754149078111,"user":{"displayName":"Lyle Earl Rementizo","userId":"08463900326265129633"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"-qJL8zU3hT_g","outputId":"a23302ee-bfea-4c46-ba62-24e99b556e55"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt_tab to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt_tab.zip.\n"]}],"source":["nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('punkt_tab')\n","\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"id":"04e6ef57","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":21,"status":"ok","timestamp":1754149078114,"user":{"displayName":"Lyle Earl Rementizo","userId":"08463900326265129633"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"04e6ef57"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from google.colab import drive"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"BmDxz5SNfdb6","metadata":{"id":"BmDxz5SNfdb6"},"source":["Now that our libraries are set up, the next logical step is to load our dataset.

I just traveled from Toronto to Berlin and back with two kids (5 and 7yrs old). The stopover in Iceland breaks up the trip more evenly (two medium duration flights), which was better for us than one really long and one really short flight. Also, kids get priority boarding, free food on the flight, a bag of interesting activities (stickers, games), and the entertainment system has a whole kid section. On our way back from Berlin we missed our connection because of a severe thunderstorm in Berlin (It was bad! Heavy winds and rain, thunder and lighting. I'm glad we didn't have to take off in those conditions). Once we arrived in Iceland and our flight to Toronto had left, Icelandair rebooked us on a flight for the next day and put us in a 5-star hotel for the night, with taxi, dinner, breakfast and lunch paid for. Our room had a view of the ocean and we had some time to explore the spectacular Icelandic coast. I was worried that we'd have to spend the night on a hard bench on the airport, instead we were treated to an extra day of vacation on this amazing island! Thank you, Icelandair!!\",\n          \"  We had booked a flight with Tigerair Australia for our soccer team to fly out from Sydney to Melbourne on Friday the 6th March 2020 for a soccer tournament. This flight was booked on the 20th of February 2020. After checking in the day before, we received a message from Tigerair on Friday the 6th of March at 9:30 am informing us that our flight has been cancelled \\\"due to poor weather conditions\\\" and that they had put us on the next a available flight which was on Saturday the 7th of March at 3:40 pm. However, we had already booked our hotel for Friday and our first soccer match of the tournament was on Saturday 11 am. After calling their customer service, we were told that they could not do anything about it other than provide a flight credit valid for 6 months. They also told us that we will not be given a refund as they cannot control the poor weather conditions. We were forced to book a last minute flight on the same day (Friday 6th of March) costing us $400 one way with Virgin Australia Airlines. It is interesting to know that only Tigerair had cancelled their flights for that day and no other airline did. Very poor customer service and will not book with them ever again. I hope they go bankrupt and in liquidation. It is also interesting that Tiger Airways Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Virgin Australia. Something fishy was definitely going on as the weather was perfectly fine on that day (both in Sydney and Melbourne).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

Stopwords are very common words, like 'the', 'is', 'a', or 'in', that appear all the time but don't carry much specific meaning. To handle this, we first load the standard list of English stopwords that NLTK provides. Then, for each review, we go through our list of tokens from the previous step and build a new list that includes only the words that are not found in the stopword list. Removing these common words helps to reduce the overall size of our data and allows any future analysis to focus on the more unique and meaningful words in the reviews."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"id":"47vT5OT4g6KX","metadata":{"id":"47vT5OT4g6KX","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":863},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754149094534,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":586,"user":{"displayName":"Lyle Earl Rementizo","userId":"08463900326265129633"}},"outputId":"08fa60df-11c0-4261-e8d0-2818b1c4971e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--- Test Case after stopword removal ---\n","['bad', 'experience', 'rerouted', 'cancelled', 'flights', 'last', 'weekend', 'adria', 'airways', 'original', 'route', 'ljubljana', 'sarajevo', 'return', 'two', 'weeks', 'received', 'email', 'flight', 'cancelled', 'offered', 'route', 'change', 'ljubljana', 'sarajevo', 'via', 'munich', 'flight', 'back', 'changed', 'sarajevopristinaljubljana', 'accepted', 'first', 'flight', 'via', 'munich', 'ok', 'two', 'hours', 'return', 'flight', 'got', 'email', 'flight', 'cancelled', 'rebook', 'via', 'hotline', 'accept', 'flight', 'croatian', 'zagreb', 'reached', 'ljubljana', 'h', 'later', 'organize', 'transport', 'zagreb', 'ljubljana', 'cost', 'book', 'flights', 'adria', 'airways', 'heard', 'financial', 'situation', 'bad']\n","\n","Successfully removed stopwords.\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["   Unnamed: 0   Airline Name Overall_Rating  \\\n","0           0    AB Aviation              9   \n","1           1    AB Aviation              1   \n","2           2    AB Aviation              1   \n","3           3  Adria Airways              1   \n","4           4  Adria Airways              1   \n","\n","                            Review_Title          Review Date  Verified  \\\n","0                \"pretty decent airline\"   11th November 2019      True   \n","1                   \"Not a good airline\"       25th June 2019      True   \n","2         \"flight was fortunately short\"       25th June 2019      True   \n","3    \"I will never fly again with Adria\"  28th September 2019     False   \n","4  \"it ruined our last days of holidays\"  24th September 2019      True   \n","\n","                                              Review       Aircraft  \\\n","0    moroni to moheli turned out to be a pretty d...

Final Evaluation\n","\n","Finally, after all the cleaning steps are complete, this last section is for evaluating the results of our pipeline. This part of the code serves as our 'after' snapshot. First, we take the cleaned lists of tokens and join them back together into readable sentences. Next, we calculate the new total word count and compare it to our initial count from the beginning. This allows us to see exactly how much 'noise' we removed, and I'll display this as a percentage reduction. To make the impact really clear, I will show a direct side-by-side comparison of our original reviews and their final, fully cleaned versions.

Flight back changed to Sarajevo-Pristina-Ljubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled.

It opened at 0900hrs and I was told that the flight had been put back to 1300hrs and that they had tried to contact me. This could not be true as they did not have my phone number. I was with a local guide and he had not been informed either. I presume that I was bumped off. The later flight did operate but as usual, there was confusion at check-in. The flight was only 30mins and there were no further problems.
